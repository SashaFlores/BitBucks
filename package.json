  "description": "updating this software that tokenize real estate by integrating Zillow’s API with Google Cloud Functions to automate property data retrieval. The system leverages Solidity for smart contract development, enabling self-executing tokenization of properties on the blockchain. For cross-chain functionality, I’m building a light client in Go lang to validate transactions and securely communicate data between chains using bridges for interoperability. Additionally, the platform will support lending and borrowing by allowing users to collateralize fractionalized real estate NFTs, offering more flexibility in DeFi transactions. Google Cloud Functions automate API calls and trigger smart contract interactions upon receiving new data.",
